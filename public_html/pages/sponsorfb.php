Facebook is known for our 'Hacker' culture. We host our own <u><b>Hackathons</b></u> which are often the birthplace of some of our most popular products - Video, Chat, and Mentions all started as Hackathon projects. It gives our employees the opportunity to try out new ideas and collaborate with other people
