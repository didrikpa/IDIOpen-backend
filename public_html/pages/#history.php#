IDI Open - History
</h1>
</br>
<p>

The first IDI Open Programming Contest was held in 2007. It was Rune Johan Hovland and Eirik Reksten who came up with the idea of holding a contest in the spring. They kind of missed competing, as the only other contest on NTNU, NCPC, is held in the fall. Dr. Anne C. Elster was co-founder and
served as faculty advisor 2007-2010.

<h2>IDI Open 2009</h2>

<p>
We had 60 participating teams in 2009.</p>
</p><p>
#define NAME_to_be_defined, consisting of Christos Tzamos, Håkon Hitland and Ruben Spaans, won this years IDI Open with a total of 8 problems solved. They were followed by Team Evil Enterprise Edition (Yahoo!) and two teams from University of Aarhus (all which solved 7 problems). The next best student onsite teams were Nord og ned i tåkeheimen and brainfucked (these two solved 6 problems).
</p><p>
All onsite teams solved at least one problem, even though one of the easys came off as harder than we believed it'd be. None of the onsite teams solved any of the three hardest problems (one team from Aarhus solved one, Robotic Encryption), and thus we didn't get to award any of the balloon animals this year.
